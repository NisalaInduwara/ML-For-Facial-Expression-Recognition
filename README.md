# ML-For-Facial-Expression-Recognition

## Overview of the project
In this project I have trained a ML model to recognize the facial expressions. The data set has been taken from the kaggle web site below I have mentioned the attributes and the target variable of the data. There are 7 number of categories of facial expressions are included in the data set such like angry, happy, fear, neutral, etc. To train the model I have used CNN networks and some of optimization algorithms.
